				<p class="sheader">Splitting the Atom</p>
				<p>Can one tiny atom power your grid? Maybe not, but many of these atoms in a chain reaction can! This is the premise of nuclear energy.
				The form in use today is nuclear fission, which involves starting a chain reaction with neutrons in order to split a large atom's nuclei (usually U-235) into 
				two smaller nuclei. This split releases lots of energy and more neutrons which hit other atoms and keeping the chain reaction going until the fuel
				is depleted. This energy source is highly controversial due to a few large incidents in the past.</p>

				<p class="sheader">An Oversimplified History of Nuclear Power</p>
				<p>It all started in 1895 when Wilhelm Roentgen discovered x-rays and studied them. A year later, Henri Becquerel would study these rays and would discover
				that uranium emitted rays on its own. In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie would study this phenomenon and would isolate two other elements that exhibit the same
				phenomenon, and they would also coin the term "radioactivity". Ernest Rutherford studied radiation and discovered alpha and beta radiation, as well as the concept
				of "half-life". In 1909, he discovers the nucleus of the atom. In 1920, he would theorize that there were neutral particles in that nucleus, which he called
				a "neutron". In 1932, James Chadwick would prove the existence of this neutron. Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman would split a uranium atom by shooting a neutron at it,
				,and Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch would recognize this to be nuclear fission. in the same year, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard would perform neutron multiplication
				studies in order to see if a chain reaction was possible, and they found that it was indeed possible. After this discovery, Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and Edward
				Teller wrote a letter to Franklin Roosevelt warning of nuclear weapons. They convinced Einstein to sign it to make it more credible in the eyes of the president.
				Roosevelt approved a small-scale study into uranium and by 1942, Fermi was able to demonstrate a successful chain reaction. The Manhattan Project would reach
				its peak and two kinds of bombs were being made simultaneously. In 1945, the Trinity test was conducted. Despite being the first test in the world, it was successful.
				Later that year, the two bombs ("Little Boy" and "Fat Man") were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This facilitated Japan's surrender.
				The first time nuclear was used to generate electricity was in 1951, on the EBR-1 reactor. However, reactors like these were first used
				to power submarines. The Obinsk power plant in the Soviet Union opened in 1954, becoming the first commercial nuclear power plant. In 1979,
				the first of the three major disasters occured, the Three Mile Island incident. The radiation was largely contained. The next disaster would
				come in 1986, the Chernobyl incident. The disaster caused widespread damage and shifted the public opinion. In the same year, safety tests showed
				that advanced nuclear reactors can be much safer. The US and Russia signed a treaty to decomission their weapons and turn them into fuel
				instead in 1994. In 2011, the third major disaster happened, the Fukushima incident. This was caused by a tsunami which damaged the reactors and their
				safety systems. Today, nuclear is one of the safest methods to produce power, due to advances in technology as well as more stringent regulations
				that came about as a result of the major disasters. We are also starting to make progress in the pursuit of nuclear fusion, but we will have to wait
				for what the future holds.

				<h5>Pro 1: Clean energy</h5>
				<p>Nuclear power does not emit carbon due to the fuel not being made of organic material or even used for combustion. It heats
				water to produce steam that turns a turbine.</p>
				
				<h5>Con 1: Accidents are incredibly devastating</h5>
				<p>The three great disasters have left the areas they are in largely uninhabitable. While safety is a top priority when building a reactor,
				natural disasters such as the earthquake and tsunami that destroyed Fukushima may still happen.</p>
				
				<h5>Pro 2: Stable production</h5>
				<p>Nuclear energy is clean but does not rely on the weather to operate. It can serve as a base load. When the weather isn't fit for renewable
				energy production, it can supply that missing power.</p>
				
				<h5>Con 2: Nuclear Waste</h5>
				<p>The depletion of the fuel used in a nuclear reactor leaves us with nuclear waste. We store them deep underground in safe storage
				facilities for now, but that doesn't mean that a leak is impossible. However, some reactors can use this waste to make more energy.</p>
				
				<h5>Pro 3: Low operation costs</h5>
				<p>Nuclear plants only need to be maintained once every year or few years, which means operation costs are lower.</p>
				
				<h5>Con 3: High initial cost + time</h5>
				<p>Nuclear reactors cost lots of money to build. This is in order to meet safety regulations. Operators also need to build storage facilities
				for the nuclear waste.</p>
				
				<h5>Pro 4: High energy density</h5>
				<p>This energy source far more energy-dense than fossil fuels. This means that each piece of fuel lasts longer and generates
				less waste.</p>
				
				<h5>Con 4: Not renewable</h5>
				<p>First, we have a limited supply of uranium. This uranium would last us about 80 years, while more than fossil fuels, it's still not much.
				Second, extracting the uranium can cause harm to the environment.</p>
