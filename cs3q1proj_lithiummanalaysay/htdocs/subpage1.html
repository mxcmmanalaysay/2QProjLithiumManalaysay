				<p>4000 years ago, a Chinese man encountered a strange black rock. This rock burned similarly to a log. This rock was coal, and archaeologists thought that this was the first recorded usage of a fossil fuel.
				Coal was rare back then and only a few used it. Then in the 1200s, the British used it due to the inability of firewood to keep up with growing demand.</p>

				<p>Enter the (first) industrial revolution. Before this, coal was limited to smithery and smelting. With the introduction of the steam engine, the first factories were born.
				Steam engines are powered by that same black rock, and with the widespread use of the steam engine, the use of coal went with it.</p>

				<p>Later on, the internal combustion engine was invented. This then enables the use of the previously rarely used petroleum.
				Gasoline, one of its components, power most automobiles.</p>

				<p>Today, fossil fuels quite literally power the world. Coal, oil, and gas account for about 84% of world energy production (as of 2019). 
				This is a big problem, as the production of energy from these sources wreaks havoc on the environment, the earth, and eventually us humans.</p>

				<p>A lot of the world's coal is taken from mining, which already destroys the environment. The process is started by clearing an area. 
				This may involve clearing a large amount of forest or mountain. Layers of ground are removed one by one just to find the coal.
				Drainage and runoff can pollute the surrounding bodies of water, such as rivers and lakes. Methane from underground mines may collect and explode, resulting in loss of life and property.
				To get crude oil, a structure is built to dig into the ground and pump oil. If the oil is deeper in the earth, hydraulic fracturing may be used.
				In this method, fluid (mostly water, with a few additives) is pumped into a crack in the earth in order to open it to extraction.
				Contaminated water is stored in pits on the surface. This may leak into nearby drinking water systems. This process is also wasteful in terms of water.
				Millions of gallons may be used on a single well. The additives are kept secret and may be hazardous to human health.</p>

				<p class="chartcaption">This diagram by NRDC explains how fracking works and how it is hazardous in different ways</p>
				
				<p>Once the mining is done, the next step is transportation and usage. There are some carbon emissions from the transport process, but most of the carbon comes from the usage itself.
				Since coal is mostly carbon, it is the fuel with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, sitting at about 820 tons of emissions throughout a plant's entire cycle. Oil is a close second, 
				at about 720 tons. Global warming isn't the only thing we have to worry about, we also have to worry about the air pollution. According to WHO, 4.5 million people die to outdoor (ambient)
				air pollution every year. In the year 2018, 1 in 5 people died due to the air pollution caused by the burning of coal and oil, which <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121000487">a study</a> revealed.
				When transport goes wrong, especially with oil, catastrophic consequences may occur. Oil spills can disrupt marine ecosystems and can spread out for miles. Oil can poison marine wildlife,
				through ingestion and possibly inhalation through the gills. Plankton may die due to the oil, disrupting the marine food chain. Oil can also harm birds by covering their feathers and rendering them cold, wet, and unable to fly.
				Same goes for marine mammals which rely on their fur to keep them warm.</p>

				<p>There are much more detriments to fossil fuels than I can explain, but the point is, continuing to use them in our energy mix is harmful to the environment and ourselves.
				It doesn't matter if we use renewables or nuclear power, we just have to ditch fossil fuels entirely. By doing so, we can take an important step towards carbon neutrality, and eventually,
				we may be even able to reverse our effects on the earth.</p>
